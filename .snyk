        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet. YAML files are loaded only
          as text fixtures (trusted source and execution context.)
          Risk is acceptable.

  SNYK-PYTHON-SQLALCHEMY-173678:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          CKAN 2.8 doesn't appear to be compatible with SQLAlchemy 1.2.
          CKAN 2.9 is, however.  To properly evaluate the risk,
          we should examine all use of 'group_by' and 'order_by'
          to determine that all input to those operators are sanitized.

    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Fix is created but not yet published.
          Risk appears to be very low.  The vulnerability is in the passlib
          bcrypt() implementation, and CKAN (2.8) uses pbkdf2.  In addition,
          in production environments we use a SAML provider for auth.

  SNYK-PYTHON-WEBOB-40490:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation path available for CKAN2.8 (not compatible
          with webob > 1.0.8).

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-590065:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          Python cryptography package, I see no use of the vulnerable
          method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface, 
          so the risk here is very minimal.
